How we built it
With our simple user-friendly design, patients of all ages, including those who are less technologically literate, can easily navigate through the website. Using CSS, Javascript, and HTML, we designed PharmaBuck$. We chose Visual Studio as our development environment where we collaborated on a web application that will serve as a financial relief resource for these challenging times.

What it does
Our team decided to implement a search feature that allows quick access to the prices of drugs. For example, if we need to search for Sudafed... the list will condense into one option. We can then click these prices, it will bring you to their website. If we type Motrin, you can see what the list offers. If we type the letter ‘f’, you can see which drugs name has an f in them.

Challenges
During the development of our website, we faced challenges of using an API to extract data regarding the prices of each medicine. We were unable to access it so we had to manually extract the information and convert it into an Excel sheet.

What we learned/Accomplishments we're proud of
As this was our first hackathon, we came into this competition blindly with no prior knowledge. Throughout these 10 hours, we developed a website which we are each proud to present. We gained knowledge of various coding languages and developing environments. Our communication skills were also enhanced despite having virtual barriers.

What's Next for PharmaBuck$
We plan to further improve our web application adding more drugs, their prices, as well as more pharmacies to the search engine.
